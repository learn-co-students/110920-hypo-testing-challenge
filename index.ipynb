Specifically, create two array-like variables `discounted` and `not_discounted`, distinguished from each other based on the values in the `Discount` column and containing values from the `Quantity` column.  (In other words, two \"lists\" of quantities, although those \"lists\" can be Pandas Series objects, NumPy arrays, base Python lists, or any other array-like.)  The definition of \"discounted\" is that `Discount` is greater than 0."
